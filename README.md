# esx-qalle-wheelchair

[NOTES]

* This is not *RECOMMENDED* to use on full servers, this script is still buggy because of gta physics: the closest player "owns" the wheelchair which bugs it for other players. It works with smaller playerbase.

[REQUIREMENTS]
  
* ESX Support

[INSTALLATION]

1) CD in your resources/[esx] folder

2) Add this in your server.cfg :
``start esx-qalle-wheelchair``

[TODO]

* Checks if someone else is in the wheelchair / holding the wheelchair
* Fix rotations when sitting (im lazy)
